  - We expect that you know the details of the papers yourself.
  - You cannot expect to get help to understand topics of the papers.
  - The supervision time should be focused on how to prepare the report.

## Aids

All aids are permitted, but remember to cite any sources that you use.
Apart from discussing the papers with other people, you are not allowed to get help from other people when working on your report.
We are also reminding you that you, when registering for the semester, signed that you have read and understood the rules for **cheating and plagiarism** in the Exam Rules and Regulations at the University of Stavanger.
Plagiarism control will be carried out.

## Exam Delivery

The exam submission consists of a report in PDF format with a maximum of 3000 words.
In addition, you are encouraged to include figures, illustrations, graphs, pseudo-code, and so on.
The report is individual.

The exam **must** be delivered in PDF format on Canvas.

## Exam Description

You are expected to review the course material related to Paxos and Multi-Paxos available [here][13], including the relevant lab material.
This will form the basis for comparison with two additional consensus protocols that you have been assigned.
You are expected to read supplementary material as needed and cite those works appropriately and where relevant.

The report's goal is to demonstrate your understanding of Paxos and your assigned protocols and your ability to contrast the works.
Here is a guide to what you should include in the report:

1. Succinctly describe both Paxos and your assigned protocols, including the assumed system model.
2. Clearly identify differences between the protocols.
3. Clearly identify the differences and similarities between underlying assumptions, failure and system model.
4. Discussion of the pros and cons of each protocol. This could be, but not limited to:
   - Overheads
   - Performance, e.g., throughput and latency
   - Other relevant metrics discussed in your assigned papers
   - Use of Performance enhancing techniques, e.g., pipelining and batching
5. Identify the potential applications of the protocols.

You are expected to use *message sequence charts* or *space-time diagrams* to illustrate the different protocols and the differences between them.
Tables are often a nice way to organize a comparison between different criteria and characteristics of protocols.

## Criteria for Grading

Please follow guidelines in [System Paper Writing][11].
